Object in general sense = It is thing that we can see Or touch
  It has characteristic and action that it can perform
Similarly In programming world

There are two types of Objects
1)In Build that we can access its methos by using . operator
2)that we can create 
for in loop => by using this loop we can access the property of an object one by one
note:-access with array in for loop
var obj = {
  "name" : "tushar",
  "city" : "nagpur",
  "weight" : 50,
};
   for(key in obj){
    document.write(obj[key]+ "<br/>");
   }
