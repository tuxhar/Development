#LiveScript=EcmaScript=JavaScript
    It is a light weight,open source client side scripting language.

#Feature OR Uses
    1)It is used to create dynamic web page
    2)we can create richer client side interface by using javascript.
    3)javascript can be use for security propuse and validation.
    4)javascript can be use to fetch user information. 

#Advantages
 less server interaction
 immediate feedback to user
 richer interface

#Java VS JavaScript
	1)java is a programming language while javascript is a scripting language
	2)javascript runs on browser while java runs on jvm machine OR browser as well
	3)javascript is not that complicated but java is complicated and strict
	4)javascript is used to create dynamic web page where as java is used to create standalone application
#internal and external linking
    internal = we can use anywhere in html code
    external = 
#variable=it is a container of value
  Rules=>1)we do not use any special character except underscore
         2)we do not use any number in front
         3)we reserve keyword var in front of it
         e.g var x=4,y=5,z="tushar"; 
   Note:=>we can categories variable into two different scope
   local = if we define a variable in a function then we cannot access outside of that function
   global = we can access it anywhere in the script 
#function = reusable code block
  1)predefined function
  2)user defined function
  function say(para1,para2..){

  }
  say(argu1,argu2..);         	  
#comment
	//this is single line comment
	/*this is multi line 
	comment*/
#Dialog Box
	1)alert("hello");
	2)confirm("are you ready to delete this"); //it returns two boolean values
	3)prompt(); //it is used to get user input as string
Note:if you want to get insert integer value then write
   parseInt(prompt("enter first number"));
#There are four ways to display a variable:
var person = "John Doe";
	document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = person;
	document.write(person);   //  for testing
	console.log(person);     // for debugging
	window.alert(person);   // to popup
#Condition Statement
	1)if{}
	2)if{} else{}
	3)if{}else if{}else{}
	4)switch case
#break and continue
  break = Exit the loop
  continue = not run the condition after that it will continue
#loop
	1)for(){}
	2)while{}
	3)do while{}  	
NOTE:->In JavaScript almost everything is Object except Primitives.
primitive values are those that does not have property and method.
primitive DataType that has a primitive value.
	1)Number
	2)String
	3)Boolean
	4)Null
	5)Undefined
Note=> Primitive DataType are immutable but object are mutable
#OBJECT=>
	Object in general sense = It is thing that we can see Or touch
	  It has characteristic and action that it can perform
	Similarly In programming world
	It is a variable that has properties and methods.
	  properties=> It is collection of name and value
      methods=> methods are action that performed on object.

There are two types of Objects
1)In Build that we can access its methos by using . operator
2)that we can create 
for in loop => by using this loop we can access the property of an object one by one
note:-access with array in for loop
var obj = {
  "name" : "tushar",
  "city" : "nagpur",
  "weight" : 50,
};
   for(key in obj){
    document.write(obj[key]+ "<br/>");
   }
